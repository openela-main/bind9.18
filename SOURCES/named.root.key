        # Servers which were already using the old key (19036) should
        # roll seamlessly to this new one via RFC 5011 rollover. Servers
        # being set up for the first time can use the contents of this
        # file as initializing keys; thereafter, the keys in the
        # managed key database will be trusted and maintained
        # automatically.
